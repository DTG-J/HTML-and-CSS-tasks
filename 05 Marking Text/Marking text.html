<abbr title="SoC">(Separation of concerns)</abbr>  is a principle used in programming to separate an application into <sup>units</sup>, 
with minimal overlapping between the functions of the individual units. 
<br />
<p><abbr title="SoC">Separation of Concerns</abbr> results in more degrees of freedom for some aspect of the program's design, deployment, or usage. Common among these is increased freedom for simplification and maintenance of code.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Separation of concerns is a form of <em>abstraction</em>.</strong> As with most abstractions, separating concerns means adding additional code interfaces, generally creating more code to be executed. The extra code can result in higher computation costs in some cases, but in other cases also can lead to reuse of more optimized code.</p>
